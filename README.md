Programming Exercise(given by @neoneo):

It goes like this â€” you get a string like "AAABBBBBBBCCDEEE" and replace all consecutive duplicates with a number and a character to get "3A7B2CD3E". So it's a really simple compression algorithm.

It's quite interesting because there's not a really pleasant simple way to do it. Anyway, one way to attack it is by writing very small incremental tests and making them pass.
